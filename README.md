FILE_PATH = “Make a numbers .cs file "
MESSAGE = "Write here message "
FILE_TO_SEND = r"Give file path"

Variable	Description
FILE_PATH	Path to CSV file
MESSAGE	Text message to send
FILE_TO_SEND	Absolute path of the file/image

Installation

   1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install selenium WebDriver-manager pandas
   2️⃣ Install Google Chrome

🛡 Safety Guidelines

⚠️ Important Recommendations

Keep a delay of 8–10 seconds between messages

Avoid sending messages to unknown numbers

Do not send large volumes at once

Excessive automation may lead to temporary account bans

❗ Common Issues & Solutions
Issue	Solution
File not sending	Increase wait time before clicking send
XPath not found	WhatsApp UI may have changed
QR appears repeatedly	Clear browser cache
Message not delivered	Check phone number format
⚠ Limitations

Relies on WhatsApp Web UI (XPaths may break)

Manual QR code scanning required

Not designed for high-volume spam messaging

🚀 Future Improvements

✅ Retry failed numbers

📊 Excel file support

🖼 Add captions to images

📁 Multiple file support

📈 Message status logging
